        <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Kitana Carbajal Juarez, pronouns she/her/ella. I am a first-gen undocumented student. I am a multimedia
        artist that focuses my art around the many colors of my community and sharing stories 
        of unspoken voices. My interest of themes are 
        discovering more of my latinidad and the way immigration policies affect relationships
        within communities. Art is my form of healing and advocacy.</p> 
        <p> Some mediums I have worked with are; drawing, painting, sculpture, and digital art.
        I am currently the Arte y Cultura Student Intern at the UCI Latinx Resource Center and a
        fellow of the UndocuArt Collective with the UCI DREAM Center.I am also working with some
        students on creating an outside collective to continue community building after college</p>
