    <p>Hi! My name is Kitana, I am a first-gen undocumented student. I am a multimedia
    artist that focuses my art around the many colros of my community and sharing stories 
    of my community and sharing stories of unspoken voices. My interest of themes are 
    discovering more of my latinidad and the way immigration policies affect relationships
    within communities. Art is my form of healing and advocacy.</p> 
    <p> Some mediums I have worked with are; drawing, painting, sculpture, and digital art.
    I am currently the Arte y Cultura Student Intern at the UCI Latinx Resource Center and a
    fellow of the UndocuArt Collective with the UCI DREAM Center.I am also working with some
    students on creating an outside collective to continue community building after college</p>
